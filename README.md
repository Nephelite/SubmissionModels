## README for Project
Run Rank Model first. Streak Model and Combined Model use the files generated from Rank Model. 
We have copies of the files needed in there already, so you can run Streak and Combined first if you wish,
but to understand where auxiliary files like 'MatchedRecords.csv' and 'helper.csv' come from, run Rank Model.

This also means, if you want to investigate other time periods, you should run Rank Model first to generate those files
(after changing all the date variables within the code), then copy and paste them into Streak and Combined models 
with the correct name (after also changing the date variables within the code).
